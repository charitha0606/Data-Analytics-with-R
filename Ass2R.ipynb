    "When applying the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently identify prime numbers, it is crucial to grasp the rationale behind limiting the sieving process to numbers up to the square root of the given range, denoted as √1000 in this instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, composite numbers (non-prime) are composed of prime factors. For any composite number 'n,' at least one of its prime factors, let's call it 'p,' will always be such that 'p' is less than or equal to √n. If there were two prime factors greater than √n, their product would exceed 'n,' which is logically impossible. Hence, to ascertain the primality of a number, it suffices to examine potential factors up to √n.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we embark on the process of marking multiples of a prime number 'p,' we commence with the square of 'p' (p^2). This choice stems from the fact that any smaller multiple of 'p' (e.g., 2p, 3p, etc.) would have already been marked as a multiple of a smaller prime during previous iterations. For instance, when marking multiples of 5, we start with 5^2 = 25 since any smaller multiples (5, 10, 15, 20) have already been identified as multiples of 2 or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress through the list of prime numbers, we consistently mark multiples of primes as composites. Crucially, the multiples we designate as composites will always be less than or equal to the square of the prime number currently under consideration. This ensures effective identification and elimination of all non-prime numbers up to the square root of the given range.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing the sieve up to √n, any remaining unmarked numbers are guaranteed to be prime. These survivors have withstood the elimination process, indicating that they have no smaller prime factors. Consequently, these unmarked numbers represent prime numbers within the specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided R code for finding prime numbers up to 1000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, this optimized approach significantly reduces computational complexity and time by efficiently sieving out composites while concentrating on numbers up to the square root of 1000, approximately 31.6. Beyond this threshold, any unmarked numbers are, by definition, prime numbers."
